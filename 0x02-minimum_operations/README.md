Minimum Operations

This program calculates the minimum number of operations needed to obtain a specific number of characters in a text file. The file initially contains a single character 'H', and the available operations are "Copy All" and "Paste".
Prototype

python

def minOperations(n):
    """
    Calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.

    Args:
        n: An integer representing the desired number of H characters.

    Returns:
        An integer representing the minimum number of operations needed.
        If n is impossible to achieve, returns 0.
    """

Example

python

n = 9
print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))
# Output: Min # of operations to reach 9 char: 6

n = 4
print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))
# Output: Min # of operations to reach 4 char: 4

n = 12
print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))
# Output: Min # of operations to reach 12 char: <result>

Approach

The program follows a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem efficiently. It calculates the minimum number of operations needed to reach each number up to the given target number 'n' by iteratively considering smaller numbers. The algorithm keeps track of the minimum number of operations for each number encountered. It starts with the initial number '1' and builds up to the target number 'n'. The result is the minimum number of operations for 'n'.
