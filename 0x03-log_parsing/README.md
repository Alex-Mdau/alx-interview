Log Parsing

This is a script that reads input from stdin line by line and computes metrics based on the log data.
Usage

To use the script, follow these steps:

    Run the log generator script to generate log data:

    bash

    ./0-generator.py | ./0-stats.py

    The script will read the log data line by line and calculate the following statistics:
        Total file size: The sum of all previous file sizes.
        Number of lines by status code: Displays the count of each status code encountered in the log data.

    The statistics will be printed after every 10 lines or when a keyboard interruption (CTRL + C) occurs.

Log Format

The expected input format for each log line is as follows:

php

<IP Address> - [<date>] "GET /projects/260 HTTP/1.1" <status code> <file size>

If the format of a line does not match this pattern, the line will be skipped.
Sample Output

Here is an example of the output generated by the script:

yaml

File size: 5213
200: 2
401: 1
403: 2
404: 1
405: 1
500: 3

This indicates that the total file size is 5213, and the number of lines with each status code is shown.
